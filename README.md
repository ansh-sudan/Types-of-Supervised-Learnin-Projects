Types of Supervised Learning Projects


Overview

This repository contains various supervised learning projects to demonstrate different applications and techniques within this field. Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, and this repository covers a range of algorithms and use cases.


Projects



Current Projects


Linear Regression:

This project demonstrates simple and multiple linear regression techniques, highlighting how to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more predictor variables.


Decision Tree:

This project illustrates the use of decision trees for both regression and classification tasks, showcasing how to make decisions based on a hierarchical model of decisions and their possible consequences.


Upcoming Projects


Logistic Regression:

Binary Logistic Regression: This project will cover binary classification problems using logistic regression.

Multiclass Logistic Regression: This project will explore how logistic regression can be extended to handle multiple classes.


Random Forest:

This project will demonstrate the use of random forests for both classification and regression tasks, showing how ensemble learning methods improve predictive performance.
